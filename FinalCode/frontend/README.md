# BioScope

Problem Statement: The Indian Ecosystem has grown exponentially in past few years but unfortunately on the ground level there is a lot of Illegal/Unfair anti-environment activities happening which are not met with proper outcomes due to lack of awareness and action.

With BioScope we aim to give people a safe platform to share the concerning & illegal activities which they are witnessing directly to the authority but anonimously. 
The anonimity gives people the security and the confidence to come forward against bullish industries/people harming our cities and environments.

Using BioScope you can report concerning issues directly to the concerned authorities just by sharing it on the BioScope application.

The user can submit the issue openly or anonimously as the user prefers.

On the user's end, the user has to be verified using strong proof of identity(such as aadhar no.) to authenticate the user properly and if a user is caught submitting wrong tips repetitevely or attempting to spam the application, they will be flagged and blocked off the application, having their aadhar they can be tracked easily in case of serious contentions are found.
